  "about": {
    "title": "About the Project",
    "subtitle": "Scientific Research Project that uses artificial intelligence to assist in the diagnosis of brain tumors.",
    "introTitle": "What is this project?",
    "intro": "This is a medical diagnostic support system that uses artificial intelligence to identify and classify brain tumors in MRI scans. The goal is to help healthcare professionals detect tumors more quickly and accurately.",
    "whatIsCnnTitle": "How Does Artificial Intelligence Analyze Images?",
    "whatIsCnn": "The system uses a technology called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is inspired by how the human brain processes visual information. This network was trained with thousands of MRI images to learn to recognize patterns that indicate the presence of tumors.",
    "howItWorksTitle": "How Does the System Work?",
    "howItWorksDesc": "The analysis process happens in stages:",
    "step1": "Image Preparation: The system adjusts the size and format of the scan image so it can be analyzed.",
    "step2": "Intelligent Analysis: The neural network examines the image looking for characteristics that may indicate the presence of tumors.",
    "step3": "Classification: The system identifies whether there is a tumor and, if so, classifies the type (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, or no tumor).",
    "step4": "Result: The system presents the diagnosis with a confidence percentage, showing how certain it is of its analysis.",
    "modelTitle": "The Artificial Intelligence Model",
    "modelDesc": "We use the MobileNetV2 model, a neural network recognized for its efficiency and accuracy. This model was initially trained with millions of general images and then specifically refined to recognize brain tumors.",
    "datasetTitle": "Dataset Used",
    "datasetDesc": "The system was trained and tested with the Brain Tumor MRI Dataset, publicly available on Kaggle. This database contains over 7,000 MRI images, divided into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor.",
    "datasetLink": "Access Dataset on Kaggle",
    "resultsTitle": "System Performance",
    "resultsDesc": "The system demonstrated high accuracy in the tests performed:",
    "accuracy": "Overall accuracy rate of 90.6% in tumor identification and classification",
    "tumorDetection": "Identification of healthy brains (no tumor): 97.2% accuracy",
    "pituitaryDetection": "Identification of pituitary tumors: 96.0% accuracy",
    "gliomaDetection": "Identification of gliomas: 94.4% accuracy",
    "meningiomaNote": "Note: Distinguishing between gliomas and meningiomas can be challenging, as these tumors may have similar visual characteristics in some scans.",
    "limitationsTitle": "Limitations and Precautions",
    "limitation1": "The system was tested only with images from the database used in training. Images from other equipment or hospitals may present different results.",
    "limitation2": "Differences between MRI machines, settings, and scanning techniques may affect system performance.",
    "limitation3": "The system does not replace professional medical evaluation. It is a support tool that should be used together with the clinical expertise of specialists.",
    "futureTitle": "Next Steps",
    "future1": "Test the system with images from different hospitals and equipment to ensure it works well in various scenarios",
    "future2": "Add visual explanation features that show which parts of the image were important for the system's decision",
